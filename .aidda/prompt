write test cases 

Add more detailed test cases for all of the functions in godecide.go.
- Use the built-in example files as test input data.
- Add a flag or environment variable that causes the generation of
  example output files in the testdata directory. 
- Use the example output files as the expected output for the tests.

The goal is to be able to support PERT-chart-like structures, where a node can
have multiple parents and multiple children.
