fix expected output test cases

Right now the expected output dot files aren't matching the actual
output dot files because the nodes and edges are not in a
deterministic order in the output.  

Recommend a solution.

The goal is to be able to support PERT-chart-like structures, where a node can
have multiple parents and multiple children.
