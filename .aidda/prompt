move critical path analysis to Ast

Instead of doing the critical path analysis in the Dot() function, we should
move it to the Ast struct. This will allow us to do the critical path analysis
regardless of the output format. 

Modify the Ast struct to include a CriticalPath boolean, add a method
that does the critical path analysis, call that method after loading
from yaml, and then refer to the CriticalPath boolean in the Dot() function.

The goal is to be able to support PERT-chart-like structures, where a node can
have multiple parents and multiple children.
