hyperedge grouping

For a group of dot edges that are all created from the same hyperedge,
we want to show the probability edge label only once per group, and we
want the group of edges to be adjacent in the dot output.  

If a hyperedge has multiple children, then create a new node with
shape=point, add a dot edge from the parent to the new node, and label
that edge with the hyperedge probability.  Then create a dot edge from
the new node to each child as usual, but do not label those edges.  Do
color a child edge red if it is the critical path.

The goal is to be able to support PERT-chart-like structures, where a node can
have multiple parents and multiple children.
