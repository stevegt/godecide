support parallel children under same probability

Use the existing hyperedge structure to support PERT-chart-like
usage, where a node can have multiple parents and multiple
children.  

The input for multiple children in the same hyperedge would look like
this, where bar and bong are children of alt that are grouped in the
same hyperedge, and bing is a child of alt in a different hyperedge:


alt:
  desc: alternative
  days: 365
  paths:
    bar,bong: .5
    bing: .5

The goal is to be able to support PERT-chart-like structures, where a node can
have multiple parents and multiple children.
